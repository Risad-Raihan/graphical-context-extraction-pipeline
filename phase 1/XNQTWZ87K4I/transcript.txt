[00:00:00.660 -> 00:00:06.460] So how do you make a website compliant with GDPR and other international data privacy laws?
[00:00:07.580 -> 00:00:11.220] Again and again, we've seen the same common mistakes on
[00:00:11.200 -> 00:00:14.580] hundreds and thousands of websites.
[00:00:14.760 -> 00:00:19.980] So I want to go through three very common mistakes in this video to make sure that you don't do the same mistakes.
[00:00:20.480 -> 00:00:27.800] So one of them is that do you have a cookie banner which blocks cookies before you have explicit consent?
[00:00:27.780 -> 00:00:30.898] Okay, I want to show you how it can be done.
[00:00:31.622 -> 00:00:34.840] So if you take a look on on this website right here,
[00:00:35.600 -> 00:00:40.400] we have a cookie banner which communicates a privacy notice and
[00:00:40.380 -> 00:00:47.760] also you have to embed the ability to block cookies before a user presses accept.
[00:00:48.020 -> 00:00:51.678] Okay, so that's something your solution should be able to do.
[00:00:52.140 -> 00:00:56.360] Basically be able to block cookies before you have received explicit consent.
[00:00:56.560 -> 00:00:57.022] Okay.
[00:00:57.780 -> 00:01:03.660] Another best practice you want to have included in your banner is not only the ability to accept but also
[00:01:03.640 -> 00:01:06.160] decline the cookie banner as you see right here.
[00:01:06.820 -> 00:01:14.820] In this specific case right here, we have chosen an approach of being transparent with the data we collect.
[00:01:14.980 -> 00:01:17.759] So we have what we call a detailed cookie banner.
[00:01:18.121 -> 00:01:21.000] So you can click details and you can see what type of
[00:01:21.540 -> 00:01:27.460] cookies and plugins we use on the website and your ability to change
[00:01:27.780 -> 00:01:29.161] the settings right here.
[00:01:29.560 -> 00:01:36.200] Other ways you can make it look and in style to make it fit in a beautiful way to your website is like this.
[00:01:36.620 -> 00:01:41.620] And here's another beautiful way to make it stylish and make it fit your website.
[00:01:41.800 -> 00:01:46.200] So you have a number of ways to make it look and feel perfect to your own website.
[00:01:46.380 -> 00:01:46.944] Okay.
[00:01:47.529 -> 00:01:51.520] Now that's one of the areas we want to walk through in terms of the cookie banner.
[00:01:52.040 -> 00:01:56.380] A second part is have you made it easy to withdraw consent?
[00:01:56.920 -> 00:01:57.422] Okay.
[00:01:58.020 -> 00:02:01.260] So from a technical aspect, this is quite complicated.
[00:02:01.520 -> 00:02:06.460] So in this case, let's say that I have now consented for the cookies and trackers.
[00:02:06.560 -> 00:02:11.420] Now, how do you actually change the consent?
[00:02:11.780 -> 00:02:18.320] Now, you may have difficulty because of the little widget down here, but we actually have what we call a
[00:02:18.300 -> 00:02:21.160] trust badge, which you can move in different locations on the website.
[00:02:22.460 -> 00:02:25.240] But what's really smart about it is that it's interactive.
[00:02:25.460 -> 00:02:27.300] So in the case of that.
[00:02:27.400 -> 00:02:37.120] Let's say analytics, it provides you an ability to opt in, but also opt out and basically change the users previously given consent as well.
[00:02:37.300 -> 00:02:41.160] And that's something we document inside our back end as well.
[00:02:41.300 -> 00:02:41.663] Okay.
[00:02:41.700 -> 00:02:51.400] So that's a way to communicate additional privacy information, but also to be very transparent and provide the ability to for the user to withdraw consent at a later time.
[00:02:51.540 -> 00:02:51.923] Okay.
[00:02:51.980 -> 00:02:52.881] So very important.
[00:02:53.280 -> 00:02:55.680] So that is the second point.
[00:02:55.800 -> 00:02:56.084] Now.
[00:02:56.060 -> 00:03:00.360] The third point is, do you have evidence of valid consent?
[00:03:01.140 -> 00:03:04.500] I want to show you how it looks inside the administration panel.
[00:03:04.760 -> 00:03:17.320] So if I go to consent tracking and let's say I now press refresh right here, you can then see that I have now declined for analytics right here.
[00:03:17.880 -> 00:03:24.620] So you can basically see that I have declined and we now have a record of the consent in real time.
[00:03:24.720 -> 00:03:25.681] Uh, document.
[00:03:25.780 -> 00:03:26.044] By.
[00:03:26.060 -> 00:03:27.181] Secure privacy as well.
[00:03:27.280 -> 00:03:37.660] So that's something you have to have in mind when you implement, um, a GDPR, e-privacy or LTPD solution for your websites and your company.
[00:03:37.760 -> 00:03:38.103] Okay.
[00:03:38.120 -> 00:03:39.920] So three common mistakes.
[00:03:40.200 -> 00:03:41.421] Uh, I hope it makes sense.
[00:03:41.560 -> 00:03:43.380] Otherwise, uh, we'd be happy to hear from you.
